2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net program_counter1/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin program_counter1/pcsrc_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell program_counter1/pcsrc_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net program_counter1/pc_reg[20]_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin program_counter1/sext_reg_i_2/O, cell program_counter1/sext_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net program_counter1/register_reg[1][0]_1[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin program_counter1/aluc_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell program_counter1/aluc_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net program_counter1/register_reg[1][0]_1[1] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin program_counter1/aluc_reg[3]_i_1/O, cell program_counter1/aluc_reg[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net program_counter1/register_reg[1][0]_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin program_counter1/shift_reg_i_2/O, cell program_counter1/shift_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net program_counter1/register_reg[1][0]_4 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin program_counter1/aluimm_reg_i_2/O, cell program_counter1/aluimm_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net program_counter1/register_reg[1][1]_8 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin program_counter1/m2reg_reg_i_1/O, cell program_counter1/m2reg_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net program_counter1/register_reg[31][31]_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin program_counter1/wmem_reg_i_2/O, cell program_counter1/wmem_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
